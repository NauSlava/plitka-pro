### **Model Profile: `rubber-tile-lora-v4`**

This document contains the verified technical specifications of the trained model. It is the primary source of truth for all tasks involving model interaction, debugging, or optimization.

#### **1. Core Architecture: Hybrid Model**
*   **Type:** A hybrid of **LoRA** and **Textual Inversion (TI)**.
*   **LoRA (`..._lora.safetensors`):** Contains the *style* (texture, lighting).
*   **TI (`..._embeddings.safetensors`):** Contains the *concept* (the definition of "rubber tile" linked to `<s0><s1>`).
*   **Mandatory Action:** Both components **MUST** be loaded and activated simultaneously for correct operation.

#### **2. Training Environment**
*   **Trainer:** `edenartlab/sdxl-lora-trainer` on Replicate.com.
*   **Base Model:** Custom `Eden_SDXL.safetensors` (not the standard SDXL base).

#### **3. Key Hyperparameters & Directives**
*   **Resolution:** `1024x1024`.
*   **LoRA Rank:** `32`.
*   **TI Tokens:** `2` (`<s0>`, `<s1>`).
*   **CRITICAL USAGE PARAMETER:** The optimal LoRA weight, proven during validation, is **`0.75`**. This value should be used by default.

#### **4. Actionable Directives for Interaction**
*   **Activation:** Prompts **MUST** contain the trigger phrase `ohwx_rubber_tile` and the TI tokens `<s0><s1>`.
*   **Prompting Strategy:** Prompts should be based on the simple, proven examples from the model's validation logs, **not** the complex training captions.

*   **Impact on Protocol:** This profile is the primary reference for **"Phase 1: Analysis & Planning"** and any **"Correction Loop"** related to generation quality or model errors.
